### H3 Heading

Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](http://github.com/einarijunter)?

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
import numpy as np

def test_function(x,y):
  z = np.sum(x,y)
  return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$

Testing: $$ z != x^y $$
